        <article class="myDescription">
            <p>My full name is Xiao Heng Chen, but I go by Xiao for convienence. I studied Mechanical Engineering as an undergraduate and recieved my degree May 2011. I am doing this class to expand my skillset and hopefully transition into becoming a programmer.</p> <br>
            <p>As a hobby I enjoy learning about various subjects that interest me, but in no way would help me in my career (ie. mixology, music, car tuning and modifications, just to name a few. Often I am asked how I know the answer to random questions and I can only shrug ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I also enjoy video games, but as a functioning adult, unfortunately there is little time to actually sit down and enjoy games like I use to as a kid.</p><br>
            <p>Currently I still work as a mechanical engineer and I do no intend to forget or neglect the skills I have built up for the pass decade.</p><br>
            <p>But now it is time for a change!</p>
